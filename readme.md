### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

### Technical Suggestions

Your app must:

* **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

---

### Pre-deployment checklist

- [ ] Add the deployed URL to repo settings
- [ ] Add a readme with:
  - [ ] An embedded screenshot of the app
  - [ ] Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - [ ] **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - [ ] Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - [ ] Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - [ ] Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

### Hints and Suggestions

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems. But don't change horses in the middle of the steam. Come to use if you are having doubts before restarting your project.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**. Use conventions and follow best practices.
* **Write your code DRY** 
* **build your APIs RESTful**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. 
* **Write excellent commit messages.** Don't be afraid to use git's interactive rebasing to clean up messages, combine commits, and be as useful as possible. Those viewing your source code WILL look at your commit messages.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing. Use Trello or Github's project management tools to stay organized and on track.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is? If you were working with a partner, would they be very happy to work with you?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Pass HTML5, CSS and JS linters** Write well formatted, standards-based code. Know when it's OK to break the rules (custom Angular directives within your html for one...)
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it. Even better, write code that comments itself (function fetchDataFromTwitter() // needs no further documentation or comments...)
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer game.

##### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts & important document you need to have backed up.

##### Tipping Point
Demand-driven events could really reduce waste if the event only occurs when sufficient demand is present. Imagine that an event or action only happens with enough user support. Fans demand a band play, GA students demand that we learn Angular 2, politicians hold a town hall meeting, etc.

##### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we know it.
