### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

---

### Hints and Suggestions

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer game.

##### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts & important document you need to have backed up.

##### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we know it.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Instructors will not be grading this project. We want you to use this final project as your magnum opus as you apply for jobs.

If you would like instructor feedback after your project has been completed, please **submit a link to your Github repository as a Git issue to the [`wdi-project4-gallery`](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi-project4-gallery) repository**. If you do so **by 6:00pm on Friday**, we will do our best to have feedback returned to by **COB Friday of the following week (1/22)**. If you do submit your project after the deadline, please just note that you may receive your feedback after 1/22 and will be up to instructor discretion.

### Support + Issues

Instructors will meet with students during scheduled one-on-ones, which will be with the student's squad leader. Please **submit technical issues to the `project4` repository as Git issues**. If you're feeling stuck, please review the [How to Ask For Help Doc](asking_for_help.md)

### Presentations
These will be "Science Fair-style" on Friday.
